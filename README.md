# Coding Temple Backend Specialization Project

My final project for my Coding Temple journey pre-graduation. A program designed for a fictional auto mechanic shop, with
functions for creating and storing data for customers, mechanics, shop inventory, and service tickets. Includes
full documentation with testing capability. I don't want to type out a full README like I've done for past projects,
since there is a lot to this and I don't think I'd be able to remember everything, and I think it's better to have
little info than wrong info.

Anyway, sorry if this doesn't meet your expectations. I did work really hard on it.
